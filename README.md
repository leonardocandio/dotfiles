# Dotfiles

This is the current config of the main command line tools I'm using. While this repo will always remain in a somewhat working condition, I cannot guarantee that if you copy this code you'll get the same results as me.

This is only tested in macOS with apple silicon as is the only machine I have access to.

I will try to add documentation as I continue to expand this further.

Feel free to contact me if you decide to fork this config.

Currently using:
- yazi 
- zsh 
- kitty 
- amethyst (tiling window manager)
- karabiner elements (keyboard remappings)
- nvim (forked from kickstart.nvim but customized to my liking)
